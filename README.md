# React Notes App

This project was created using React JS. If you decide to run it on your local machine, don't forget to install dependencies by running `npm install` and then `npm start` to execute the code.

This app runs with the help of other dependencies that also have to be installed in order to run correctly:

## React MDE (Markdown Editor)

`npm i react-mde`

## Showdown (Javascript Markdown to HTML converter)

`npm i showdown`

## React Split (Splits the window into two parts)

`npm i react-split`

## nano-id (id generator for new notes)

`npm i nano-id`

This is an unfinished project. Next step would be to sort out the styles for scrolling (dynamic change of text area height) and responsive design for mobile view.
